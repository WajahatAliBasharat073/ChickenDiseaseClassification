# This code is a pip-requirements file. It lists all the Python packages required for a project.

# Each line represents a package, followed by an optional version number. If a version number is not specified, pip will install the latest version of the package.

# Here is a breakdown of the packages:

# tensorflow: An open-source machine learning library developed by Google. It is designed for numerical computations, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.

# pandas: A powerful data manipulation library in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame, Series, and Index.

# dvc: Data Version Control (DVC) is a powerful tool to handle machine learning models, data sets, and any other files that change over time.

# notebook: The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

# numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

# matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.

# seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

# scikit-learn: A set of algorithms and utilities for data mining and data analysis, which are built on top of Python's scipy library.

# scipy: A Python-specific open-source software library used for scientific computing and technical computing.

# python-box==6.0.2: A Python library that simplifies data manipulation, making it possible to use a wider range of data structures, such as tuples, sets, and dictionaries, as keys in dictionaries.

# pyYAML: A YAML parser and emitter for Python and can also be used to parse JSON and other serialization formats.

# tqdm: A fast, extensible progress bar library for Python. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and updating progress bars.

# ensure==1.0.2: A library that allows you to create ensembles of different machine learning models. It enables you to train a model ensemble by specifying the model type, architecture, and hyperparameters.

# joblib: A set of tools to speed up the execution of your Python code. It provides a range of functionalities, such as asynchronous I/O, parallel programming, and shared memory access.

# types-pyYAML: A type stub package for the pyYAML library. Type stubs provide a way to inform Python's type checker about the types defined in a module.

# Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python. It is designed to make it easy to build small and simple web applications.

# Flask-Cors: A Flask extension to handle Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making it easy to build web applications that can be accessed from different domains.

# The purpose of this file is to make it easy for other developers to set up the project by running a single command: pip install -r requirements.txt. This command tells pip to install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
